        <h1>Hi! Again!</h1>
        <p>Brady is the person whose face is up there at the top of the screen. He is a human boy with some features of manhood, like an age he doesn't always remember and a realization that his diet is pretty terrible actually, but not the will to change much except drink more water and less black fizzy sugar. Sometimes.</p>

        <p>I am he, and him am me. Worst of all, I'm writing this as I speak, and I don't know who's pressing those keys. Is it me? Am I the actor, or the observer? Am I really in control here?</p>

        <p>I don't know why I'm telling you this, except that it might give me a good mark in class and allow me to get a diploma later on and succeed in the career I've chosen. Perhaps writing these three paragraphs is the most important thing I'll do this semester. Ah, a man-boy named Brady can dream.</p>
