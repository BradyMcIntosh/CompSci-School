      <h1>DONATE</h1>
      <p>That's right, what kind of self-respecting charity organization would we be if we didn't solicit money from the middle class? We accept donations just for the sake of it, but here are a few projects you might want to keep your eye on.</p>

      <h2>Sponsor a Child</h2>
      <p>Slavery is more or less illegal now, but that doesn't mean you can't take credit for the life and prosperity of a whole entire human. With our "Sponsor a Child" program, a select handful of the hundreds of thousands of orphan children we're aware of and generally capable of helping can finally get the help they need.</p>

      <h2>Crushing Poverty</h2>
      <p>Poverty may be more of a problem with satisfying the rich than with feeding the poor, but that doesn't feeding the poor is pointless! In fact, in a world where income inequality increases unchecked and at an exhilirating, accelerating rate, no amount of perfunctory, non-fungible philanthropy is enough.</p>

      <h2>Women Entrepreneur</h2>
      <p>They say the French word for women is "femmes". But what do they call entrepreneurs? Nothing! They don't even have a word for it! That's why we remain staunchly uni-lingual in our efforts to help women pull themselves up by their bra-straps. A little money goes a long way, especially since we send half of it overseas to make sure the government doesn't know what we do with it. Allegedly!</p>

      <h2>Homes for the homeless</h2>
      <p>this is oxymoron, lol luxury homes and capitalism, gib money</p>
