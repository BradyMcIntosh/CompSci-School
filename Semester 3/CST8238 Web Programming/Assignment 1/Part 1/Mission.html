      Mission

      <p>Our mission, in broad terms, is simple: to improve lives.</p>
      <p>Unlike other charity organizations, we focus primarily on long-term, permanent improvements, rather than just giving money to the lower classes only for them to waste it all on ephemeral things like food and household essentials. Through education, training and investment, we believe everyone can be given the opportunity to excel in the capitalist system, and perhaps one day be deemed worthy enough by the Free Market to pass on their own wealth to the less deserv - Er, less privileged.</p>
      <p>Key in this goal is the empowerment of women. Now that it's 2018, scientists have known for at least a decade that women are roughly equal to men in the eyes of the law, and where law glances, money glares. Or so they say.</p>

      <p>Home ownership the fastest-growing, least-risky avenue of investment, especially for people who can't afford to rent. That's why we have been bribed by- Er, we mean <em>partnered with</em> - several development firms who by the way definitely aren't affiliated with the mafia anymore, to the end of building luxury affordable housing for the homeless.</p>
      <p>Water. Who needs it? That's right, everyone, you idiot. What a stupid question. Shut up. We sell empty water bottles made from tortured sea turtles.</p>
      <p>One thing we can all agree on is that homeless people are smelly, and believe us, we're working on it. Some of those poor souls don't even know what toothpaste is, by the looks of it. Together with our partners at Oral-B, Dove and other large corporations of that sort, we can offer supplies and basic hygiene classes to those in need. "Cleaning the Streets, one bum at a time!" - Rand Paul, CEO</p>
      <p>Everyone faces difficult situations in life. Death, divorce, economic ruin, the impersonal, ever-growing desire for wealth at the expense of all else... But these are not insurmountable - except for that last one, otherwise I'd be out of a job! With our professional and definitely certified Emotional Technicians, we can make even the most horrific of pained memories and emotional hang-ups disappear amongst a chemically-induced rush of endorphins and minor-to-life-threatening hallucinations.</p>
      <p>In an emergency, we cannot rely on the dark-money funded, freedom-quelling arms of the state that answer to 9-1-1. That's why all ALOW association contracts require the use of ALOW-brand emergency services, like buckets, band-aids, and guns. Shovels come at a premium in the case of natural disaster.</p>
