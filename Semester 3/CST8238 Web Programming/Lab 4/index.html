				<h1>Q: What are the different parts of a CSS style rule?</h1>
				<h2>A: A CSS style rule consists of a selector that identifies the element that will be affected, followed by one or more declarations, or property: value pairs.</h2>
			</li>
				<hr>
			<li>
				<h1>Q: What are an element selector and grouped element selector in CSS? Provide an example of each.</h1>
				<h2>A: An element selector signals that the subsequent rules will apply to all HTML elements of the specified type. A grouped element selector is a list of elements, signaling that the rules apply to all of them. An example of a single selector is "p", the paragraph element, and a grouped selection of the paragraph and the div elements would look like "p, div".</h2>
			</li>
				<hr>
			<li>
				<h1>Q: What are class selectors in CSS? What are id selectors in CSS?</h1>
				<h2>A: A class selector signals that the subsequent rules will apply to all HTML elements labeled with the specified class. An id selector is similar but it is standard for an id to only apply to a single instance of an element in any one HTML file. For the class "header", the class selector would look like ".header", and for the id "first", the id selector would look like "#first". </h2>
			</li>
				<hr>
			<li>
				<h1>Q: What are contextual selectors in CSS?</h1>
				<h2>A: A contextual selector selects elements based on their position in the document hierarchy, also known as their ancestry or context. Examples of contexts are "descendant", "child", and "adjacent sibling". Contextual selectors are not selectors themselves, but rather apply context to other selectors.</h2>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Q: What are the three cascade principles used by browsers when style rules conflict?</h1>
				<h2>A: The three interaction rules are Inheritance, Specificity and Location. Inheritance is the concept of style rules affecting not only the elements specified in their selectors, but also all elements within those elements, and so on; Specificity refers to the specificity of selectors, such that rules with more specific selectors (for example, h3~p is more specific than p) overrule those with less specific selectors; and Location refers to the "closeness" of rules to elements - for example, an embedded, inline style rule is the "closest" rule possible, a general element selector is the "furthest", and various other scenarios are mapped out in a pseudo-hierarchy.</h2>
